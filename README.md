## ðŸ§  Reflection

This site marks the starting point of my design career.

While some sections reflect student projects and raw experimentation, every piece is honest. The portfolio will continue evolving as I grow â€” with the eventual goal of making [drewkazanis.com](https://drewkazanis.com) the home base for everything I create.

Thanks for stopping by.
