# I moved to another repository to get rid of a bug I was chasing. 
This is my personal portfolio project for Web Design 1. <br><br>

With the help of colin's classes and AI (google gemini advanced) I was able to make a usable website displaying some of my work from Web design 1 from Eastern Washington University. 
Included is a website for an idea I had, 'Carback.org', a website I made for Nirvana's "All Apologies", and a project for the 1995 movie 'Heat'. 
<br><br>
I used my own photos for my backgrounds and I used a photo of nirvana and the movie poster for the 1995 movie 'heat'; as well as a rip of 'All Apologies', from VEVO on youtube. As well as a section of the wikipedia article for the 1995 movie 'Heat'.
<br><br>

As well as a link to my photography portfolio.

I also have a contact page that forwards the user to my email address. 
I scored the domain, 'DrewKazanis.com', which I intend to hold and use in my professional career so I'm sure it will be significantly improved on but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in these 10 weeks. Truly a start to my carrer of choice! (Design)
