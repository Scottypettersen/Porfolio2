# Andrew Kazanis â€“ Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site created for Web Design I at Eastern Washington University. It showcases a selection of my design work and projects built during the course.

With the help of Colinâ€™s class and tools like AI, I was able to bring this site to life and create a space to share my creative work. This project includes real, published websites, as well as personal design experiments and client-based work.

## ðŸ§  Reflection

This site represents the starting point of my design career. Iâ€™m proud of what I was able to create in just 10 weeks, and I plan to continue refining and expanding this project as my skills grow. 

The domain [DrewKazanis.com](https://drewkazanis.com) is mine, and this site will evolve into a more complete portfolio as I continue in the design field.
